# fresh 0.2.0

* Support for {bs4Dash} custom themes.
* There's no more fonts included in the package, so if you use Bootswatch theme or want to use a custom font, you have to download the files. This can be done easily with the [gfonts](https://github.com/dreamRs/gfonts) package.


# fresh 0.1.0

* Initial release : Create Custom 'Bootstrap' Themes to Use in 'Shiny'.
