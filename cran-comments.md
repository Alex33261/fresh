Hello,
This is a new submission. This package allow to create custom Bootstrap themes to
use in other packages dpending on Bootstrap web framework, such as shiny, flexdashboard, pkgdown.
All functions are documented and tested, some tests write files in a
temporary directory using `tempfile()`, those test are not skipped on CRAN (sorry if they should).

Thank you,

Victor
